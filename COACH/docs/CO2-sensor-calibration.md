## How to calibrate CO2 sensors v1.2 ([DF Robot](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1549.html))

The calibration is done by connecting those two pins for 5 seconds. Please follow the next steps:

1. Leave the sensor working for 20 minutes in ideal environment (such as near one of the HVAC outlets in One Pool Street where CO2 reading is close to 400ppm).
2. While monitoring the values from the sensor, connect the pins indicated in the picture, without restarting the sensor, for 5 seconds. You should notice the values change to the default level (This means the sensor has been recalibrated).
3. Leave the sensor working for some time, if you notice the values are not close to the default level (~400ppm in One Pool Street), redo the calibration a second time.

### Note:

The calibration of v2.0 is basically same as v1.2, the only difference is that DFRobot exposed the calibration pads so this process could be easier.
