1. All boxes were restarted, all of them were offline except bx2.
2. CO2 readings:

Bx — testo
bx16: 630 — 570
bx18: 486 — 520

bx26: 1737 — 957
bx25: 566 — 907
bx24: 481 — 965

bx13: 595 — 711

3. Smoking won’t affect the CO2 levels! There was a smoking smell in bx18  and bx16 area at the time of taking readings, but CO2 levels seemed not affected.

1. Restarted bx21 & bx16
2. Changed broken plug of bx22![IMG_3345](IMG_3345.jpg)
3. Got info from staff that cigarette smoke is low or non existing today (felt it myself). Also they said smoke tends to be high on Monday and Tuesday, less on the other days of the week. And also less if it’s raining outside (because smokers can't use the smoking area in this case).
4. Less patients than usual today, staff told me that's the site is under-booked due to management process...
5. Explained by staff: patients usually start coming into the waiting area at 9 am, they start getting into cubicles at 10 am. Usually, all patients are out by 5 pm, only cleaning staff remains after that until 8 pm.
6. The shopping centre opens at 9 am and closes at 9 pm.

1. Restarted bx24
2. Plugged in bx23 (was unplugged partially).
3. Changed broken adapter of bx1

4. New sticker has been put on all wall-mounted boxes![photo_2024-03-14_23-08-05](photo_2024-03-14_23-08-05.jpg)
5. As a summary: Two boxes were offline; one semi-unplugged and one needed reboot. The rest stayed online from last week, which is surprisingly good – probably because there were no network breakdowns.
6. Cigarette smoke has gotten worse, it’s all over the clinic today. The staff showed me the supply vent which is directly above the smoking area.

They put a completely hidden non-smoking sign on one side and left the smoking bin on the other side, so smokers are still using it as usual.![IMG_3304](IMG_3304.jpg)

It’s literally very annoying to stay here for more than one hour because of this.

7. More patients in the waiting areas today compared to last week. Saw one of them wondering around the clinic trying to ask when their turn is going to be after waiting 1.5h.
8. Presence validation is done, we have bx26 with a faulty mmWave sensor that doesn’t match the usage state, it worked well after a restart.![IMG_2450](IMG_2450.jpg)

1. Changed broken plug of bx22

2. Network is fine, I was surprised all of them were not connected. Just restarted them one by one.

3. For data analysis later; I smelled cigarette smoke every time I was around this area. Staff also complained about this and thought someone was smoking, turned out the supply shaft of the HVAC system in the highlighted area on the map is positioned directly above the smoking area of Brent Cross shopping centre!
   Vasili knew about this and they are trying now to change the location of the smoking area or extend the shaft itself.
   This could affect our CO2 readings I think.

4. Also did some monitoring for these cubicles, mmWave and sound sensors seem to match the usage state
