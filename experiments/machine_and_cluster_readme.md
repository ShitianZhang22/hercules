# Machine Analysis and Cluster Notes

Please note that all the ipynb files are designed to be run in Google Colabs.

## Machine Analysis

Future improvements should be made to ensure that the time spent on the machines is accurate. Currently, the issue is that sometimes people are registered on the machine as part of their journey, which means that the time spent is likely longer than intended. 

I would suggest that in the future, a minimum number of data points is set for a machine so that this error doesn't happen. This would improve the results and allow more records to be used in subsequent analyses.

## Cluster Notes

The cluster analysis would benefit from more detailed patient information, including age and sex. This would give richer detail that might help explain some of the clusters.
