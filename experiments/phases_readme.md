# Phases Instructions

Each phase file includes the following folders:

* Code
* Data
* Outputs
* Combination of Machine Folders (This varies per phase but will include a combination of the different machines used during patient journies)

## Code Folders

The code file includes the code that generates the analysis using the patient journey times seen in the Findings folder. Phase 2 also includes the cluster analysis based on the time spent at each machine.

## Data Folders

The data folder holds the raw data from Ubisense for each phase that the analysis is built upon.

## Output Folders

The outputs folder contains the png images seen in the Findings folder. It also includes a CSV file for the overall journies per patient.

## Machine Folders

The machine folders hold the ipython notebooks that create the findings per machine, the png outputs of the visualisations and then a CSV of the times per machine.
